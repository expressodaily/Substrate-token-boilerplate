# Substrate ERC20 Multi

**Archived** - This repository is no longer up-to-date or maintained. Please refer to the [FRAME Balances pallet](https://crates.parity.io/pallet_balances/index.html).

A Parity Substrate SRML module for multiple ERC20 tokens. Any number of tokens can be initialized and managed using this module.

This module is based on/inspired by the [SRML Assets module](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/assets) but is implemented in a ERC20 flavour.

### Important Note

The Substrate framework, related libraries and APIs are rapidly evolving. In case this module does not work with the latest Substrate build, please submit an issue in this repo.
You can also try porting the runtime module into a freshly cloned `substrate-node-template` codebase.

### Important Note 2

This code is just a sample for learning purposes. It is not audited and reviewed for production use cases. You can expect bugs and security vulnerabilities. Do **not** use it as-is in real applications.
